# Roblox-viewer
Fetches data from ROBLOX API endpoints based on input data.

# Purpose
Why may this be useful?
For one, you can view profile info of banned users, which you can't do if you were to check their profile on the ROBLOX website.
This will also allow you to view more precise data that you can't view on a ROBLOX profile page.

# Why is it in Java?
I started this project off as something that would help me improve my Java skills, and I intend to keep it that way.

# Use
You can download the .jar file and simply run it, or you can download a copy of this project and run the displayWindow.java file, which will also run it.
