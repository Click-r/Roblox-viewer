# Roblox-viewer
Fetches data from ROBLOX API endpoints based on input data.

# Purpose
Why may this be useful?
For one, you can view the profile info of banned users, which you can't do if you were to check their profile on the ROBLOX website.
Additionally, you can also view users' outfits, which aren't accessible through normal means.

# Why is it in Java?
I started this project off as something that would help me improve my Java skills, and I intend to keep it that way.

# Use
You can download the .jar file (found in the releases section) and simply run it, or you can download a copy of this project and run the Controller.java file, which will also run it.

# External libraries used
- https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java : Handles JSON for the program.
